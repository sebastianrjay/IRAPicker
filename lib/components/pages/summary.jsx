        1. Account balances are calculated assuming

        annual withdrawal is always less than or equal to the amount by which 
        each account grows annually (which is assumed to be&nbsp;

        4. If using a traditional IRA, it may be possible to extend your years  
        of income by simultaneously withdrawing money from your IRA and 
        non-IRA accounts, and withdrawing little enough annual income from 
        your non-IRA account that you pay no federal capital gains tax.
